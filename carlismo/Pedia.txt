^___The Roman Aqueduct of Segovia, of an overall length of 813 m,
was built to channel water from the Frío River, some 18 Km away 
from the city. The aqueduct consists of two rows of superimposed 
arcades resting on 128 pillars and reaches a maximum height of 
28.5 m. At the top runs the channel, which today still carries 
water. This huge monument has not been dated precisely, although
its building techniques allow a comparison with the "Aqua Claudia" 
of Rome, which was built between 38 and 52 AD.

^___The Altamira Cave in Santander was discovered by
chance in 1869 by Marcelino Sanz de Santuola but it was not
until 1879 that the first paintings were found. Bisons
in different positions are most common, but there are also
drawings of human-like beings with animal heads and
comb- and step-like symbols difficult to interpret. Access to
the cave is restricted today because the carbon anhydride
breathed out by the visitors damages the old paintings. The
importance of them is so great that the Altamira Cave is often
referred to as the Sistine Chapel of Paleolithic Art.

^___The Legio VII Gemina, quartered at the confluence of the
Bernesga and Torio rivers in the year 68 AD, originated the
city of León, which still conserves part of the Roman Walls.
The city became capital of the Christian Kingdom of León in
the X century and holds the honor of being one of the oldest
scenarios of European parliamentarism, of which there is
written evidence: the Courts of the Kingdom, where on July 28,
1188, citizens were represented for the first time. León has
the most classical and homogeneous Gothic cathedral in Spain, 
entirely imbued with striking harmony and slenderness.

^___ The Tower of Hercules is the most representative monument
of La Coruña and, as such, constitutes the main element of the 
city's seal (depicted in the icon). It was built in the II
century, during the epoch of Emperor Trajano. The only
Roman lighthouse in the world, the Tower of Hercules is still in 
service. Its light can be seen from a distance of 60 km off the
coast. The Tower was reconstructed in the late XVI century to 
its current form. Legend has it that the demi-god Hercules, 
having killed tyrant Gerion, built the tower to mark the place 
where the event ocurred.

^___One of the largest and best preserved of all Castilian castles,
this impresive fortress was built on a hilltop ("mota" meaning just
this, hilltop) in Medina del Campo, near Valladolid. Construction 
began in the XIII century and continued until the XV century under the
Catholic Monarchs. The castle served indeed as a residence of Queen 
Isabella. Later in the XVI and XVII centuries it served as a state
prison.

^___ The Guernica tree is the symbol of basque foral rights. It is
an oak, and the tradition says that the representatives of the
basque people celebrated their meetings under its shadow. It is
located in Guernica, ancient capital city of the Vizcaya Dominion,
near Bilbao.

^___The Castilian city of Avila preserves the oldest, most
complete walled enclosure of the European Middle Ages. The
construction began in 1090 under Alfonso VI's rule to protect
the Christian territories from the Moors, but most of the work 
was carried out in the course of the XII century. Avila dates 
from Celtic Iberian times and is known as the "city of Saints 
and Stones", as it was the birthplace of Saint Teresa of Jesus
and the burial ground of the infamous Great Inquisitor 
Torquemada.

^___ Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, "El Cid Campeador", is the epitome
of the Medieval Knight. The son of a minor Castilian nobleman,
El Cid was born in Vivar, near Burgos, circa 1040. He grew up
in the household of the future King Sancho II, and soon he 
distinguished as the King's premier knight. After Sancho II was
assassinated in 1072, El Cid entered service of his brother, the
new King Alfonso VI. In 1081 however, he was banished from Castile
and set off for eastern Spain in search of honor and glory. His 
military career culminated with the capture of Valencia in 1094,
which he held and ruled until his death on July 10, 1099.

^__ The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela began in the
IX century with the discovery in 813 AD of what was said
to be the tomb and bones of Apostle St. James (Santiago in
Spanish). Compostela derives from the Spanish "campo de 
estrellas", or starry field, as the discovery was made 
during a starry night. By the XII century, the pilgrimage
to Santiago was a major activity in Medieval Europe with 
hundreds of thousands of pilgrims arriving. The scallop 
shell, proudly worn by those who had completed the hazardous
pilgrimage, became a badge of honor testifying to the faith
and courage of its wearer. Santiago ranked with Rome and the
Holy Land as one of the three great pilgrimages in Christianity.

^___ Remains of an era where, until the XV century, Christians, 
Jews and Muslims lived in harmony, the four towers of Teruel,
built at the end of the XII and beginning of the XIII centuries, 
form a characteristic complex of Mudéjar architecture. The Christian
churches used the structure and decoration of Almohad minarets, 
adapting them to their new functions. Mudéjar is the term used to 
designate the Muslims who lived in Christian territory but remained 
loyal to their faith.

^__ The Great Mosque of Cordoba, whose construction was
initiated in 784 under the rule of Abd-al-Rahman I, is
irreplaceable proof of the flourishing and splendor of 
the Umayyad Caliphate of Al-Andalus (929-1031). This 
impressive monument harbors one of the most beautiful 
architectural designs ever carried out, with the nineteen
aisles of its hall containing a forest of columns, the
curious overlapping arches and the ribbed cupola.

^__ The Giralda Tower was built between 1172 and 1198 as a minaret
of Seville's Mosque. It is believed that the Giralda Tower served
as an astronomical observatory for the world-renowned astronomers 
of Al-Andalus. When the city of Seville was negotiating its 
surrender to the Castilian troops of King Fernando III "the Saint" 
in 1248, the Moors tried to impose the destruction of the Giralda, 
ashamed that one of the most valued symbols of Islam could pass 
onto Christian hands. Prince Alfonso X --the future Wise King and 
an astronomer himself-- vehemently denied the request, threatening
to kill all the Moors of Seville if the tower was not left untouched.
Three centuries later, Copernicus himself studied the astronomy 
treaties authored by Alfonso X, the "Tablas Astronómicas Alfonsíes".

^___Almería was founded by Abd-al-Rahman III in 955 AD. Only one
century after its foundation, the city attained such a prosperity that
it was said that "When Almería was Almería, Granada was but its farm" 
(Cuando Almería era Almería, Granada era su alquería). From the end of
the Caliphate of Cordoba (1031) to the arrival of the Almoravids in
Al-Andalus (1085), Almería rose as the most important city of Muslim
Spain. The Alcazaba, built in the X century, dominates the town and is
the best preserved Moorish fortress in Spain.

^___The Puerta de Alcalá is a neoclassicist arch structure built in 1778 by order
of king Carlos III ("Madrid's best major"). It stands in the middle of the Plaza
de la Independencia, forming the gateway to the Calle de Alcalá. With 
the years it has become the most recognizable symbol of Madrid.

^___ Built in 1785, El Prado Museum was intended to be a museum of
natural history. Having been used as the headquarters of the French
cavalry during the Peninsular War, it became Madrid's Museum of Art
in 1819. El Prado houses one of the most important collection of 
paintings worldwide. The collection was first assembled by King 
Fernando VII, who reunited the artwork scattered among various royal
palaces. However, the origin of the collections owes much to the 
passion for art of Carlos I and his son, Felipe II. These were 
augmented by Felipe IV --the protector of Velázquez--, Felipe V and
Carlos III. The building that houses the collection is a neoclassic 
palace, perhaps the most beautiful in its style in Spain.

^___ After his victory in the battle of St. Quentin over the
French on August 10, 1557 --St. Lawrence's Day, San Lorenzo
in Spanish--, King Felipe II wished to build a monastery as 
a thanksgiving offering for the triumph. Built on a plan in 
the form of a grill, the instrument of the martyrdom of St. 
Lawrence, the Monastery sits on an exceptional beautiful site
in El Escorial, near Madrid. It was both the retreat of a 
mystic King, and the center of the greatest political power 
of the time.

^         
^___The Alhambra of Granada is the foremost example of Muslim civil
architecture in the West. All the refinement, wealth and delicacy
of Islamic art reached its ultimate climax in this unique building
which is a fortress, residence, and royal city all in one and finds
an extension in the magnificent gardens of El Generalife. Alhambra
means "Red Castle" in Arabic, a name derived from the color of its 
walls. Granada, the ultimate seat of learning of Al-Andalus, witnessed
the end of Arab rule in Spain when Muhammad Abu' Abd Allah (Boabdil), 
the last Nasrid king, surrendered and handed the keys of the city to 
the Catholic Kings on January 2, 1492 in return for his safe passage 
out of Spain. Legend has it that Boabdil could not help bursting into
tears when for the last time he turned to look back at the Alhambra. 
His mother Ayesha reproached him with a sentence that has become famous:
"You may well weep like a woman for what you could not defend like a man".

^___Built between 1482 and 1533, this building, originally used
for trading in silk (hence its name, The Silk Exchange), has 
always been a place of commerce. A masterpiece of late Gothic,
it illustrates the wealth and influence of Valencia, a major 
Mediterranean mercantile power of the XV and XVI centuries.

set out from Huelva with three caravels on August 3, 1492
to find a westward route to the fertile lands of Cipango 
(Japan) and Cathay (China), but he found a new continent
instead, America. On October 12, after a journey of 61
days, Columbus landed in the Bahamas and claimed the
territory for the Crown of Spain. He died without knowing
that the land he had found was indeed a new continent and 
not the East Indies. His voyage marked the beginning of the
Spanish colonial empire.

Cabrillo, among many others.

^___This church, consecrated to the Holy Virgin of Pilar, patroness not only 
of Zaragoza where the basilica is, but of all regions of Spain, is one of 
the most visited places of pilgrimage in the country. Legend relates that 
Apostle Santiago, when preaching in Spain in 40 AD, saw a vision of the Virgin,
who descended on a marble pillar supported by angels and commanded him to build
a chapel in her honor. The basilica is a baroque building, although some parts
such as the neoclassical main facade, were added in later periods. In its 
interior there are many paintings by the Aragonese Francisco de Goya, one of the
greatest painters of all time.

^___Succesively a Roman municipium, the capital of Visigothic Spain,
a northern outpost of the Arab Emirate and Caliphate of Al-Andalus,
the capital of the kingdom of Castile and later of the Spanish empire,
Toledo is the keeper of more than two millenia of history. It is the
monumental city by excellence. Its masterpieces are the product of
heterogeneous civilizations in an environment where the co-existence
of three major religions --Judaism, Christianism and Islamism-- was
a determining factor. Toledo's landmark is probably the fortified
palace of El Alcázar, its four towers rising above the city's highest
point. Though medieval in origin, its present contours are XVI-century
Renaissance in style. It has had to be rebuilt several times, the last
of these in 1940, after being razed during the Spanish Civil War.

^___The Plaza Mayor (Main Square) is located in Madrid's downtown.
King Felipe III ordered to build this impressive square between 1617
and 1619 as a part of his efforts to embellish the capital of the 
omnipotent Habsburg monarchy. The buildings are mostly Renaissance style 
and in the center there is a statue of the king. During the XVII century
this square served as a meeting place of the Gremios, the associations of 
craftsmen. In addition, it was the scenary of theatrical performances and
bullfights. Today it is one of the most genuine landmarks of the capital 
of Spain.

^___In the VIII century nearly all Spain was in Moslem hands, but in 
Asturias, shielded from the invaders by the Cantabrian mountains,the 
Christians organized their forces ans set up a kingdom with Oviedo as 
their capital. Here, in a concentrated area, they erected a group of 
pre-Romanesque buildings of the highest interest. In style, they 
continued the Visigothic tradition, with debased classical ornament, 
but carved in  manner perhaps even more rustic than that used by the 
Visigoths themselves. The oldest of these are the Cámara Santa, now 
incorporated into the Cathedral at Oviedo, and San Julián de los 
Prados, both built at the end of the VIII century, while from the 
IX century there remain San Miguel de Lillo and Santa María del
Naranco, just outside Oviedo.

^____The Monastery of Las Huelgas in Burgos was built in 1187 under
King Alfonso VIII of Castile on the site of a country residence of
the Castilian kings ("huelga" meaning repose in Ancient Spanish). 
The convent, to which only ladies of the highest rank were admitted
as nuns, was granted extraordinary privileges. Several kings were 
knighted here, including Fernando III of Castile in 1219, and 
Edward I of England in 1254. This building, with its gothic 
chapterhouse and romanesque cloister, is considered one of most 
important monuments of the Middle Ages in Christendom.

^___ Work on the monastery of Poblet, the largest Cistercian
monastery in Catalonia, began in 1174 in honor of the Virgin
Mary, and was consecrated in 1211. Ramón Berenguer IV, count of 
Catalonia, ordered to build this monastery as a thanksgiving 
offering for his victories against the Moors. When Catalonia
was united with the crown of Aragón, the monastery become a 
royal pantheon. The Aragonese kings Pedro II "the Great" 
(1196-1213), and Jaime II "the Just" (1291-1327) are entombed 
under the crossing of the church.

^___ The Torre del Oro of Seville (Tower of Gold) owes its name to the
characteristic golden reflections produced by the glaze that coated
its twelve-sided exterior. It was built in the XIII century as a part
of the city walls, although it is physically separated from them. It
served as a surveillance point, as a defensive bulwark of the city's 
port, and as a prison. After the Discovery of America, the Torre del 
Oro was utilized to store the silver and gold arriving from the colonies.

^___Bullfighting is an integral part of the Iberian culture, thriving 
nowadays in Spain, Portugal, southern France, and several Latin 
American countries, most notably Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela.
Deemed by ones as a cruel, barbaric spectacle, it is for others art
in motion, the ultimate expression of the dichotomy of life and death, the 
intelligence and courage of man confronted with the brutal force of 
beast. Bullfighting traces its origins back to the Middle Ages, when
Christians and Moors competed in hunting the wild Iberian bull. This
beautiful and awe-inspiring beast, with its unique noble bravery
would, when provoked, rather die fighting than flee.

@title=Civilization: Governments
The form of government you choose for your civilization will
affect the way resources are distributed in your cities, the
rate at which your citizens can produce and sustain new units
and city improvements, and the extent to which your citizens
have a say in the way you govern them.
^
Some forms of government, such as Despotism, Monarchy, and
later Communism and Fascism, allow you to expand rapidly,
to produce and sustain large numbers of military
units, and to control your affairs completely.
^
Democracy and the Republic, on the other hand, give your
citizens the freedom to produce vast amounts of trade, which
increases your wealth and knowledge rapidly. On the other
hand, your citizens may grow unhappy when you send military
units out of your cities; also, your Senate may try to
interfere in your conduct of foreign affairs.
^
To change your civilization's government, you must have a
Revolution--select "Revolution" from the Kingdom Menu.  This
will entail a brief period of Anarchy.

@PEDIAGOVT0
@width=600
@title=Civilization Government: Anarchy
Anarchy represents not so much a government type as the
lack of any stable government. Anarchy occurs when your
civilization's government falls, or when you decide to
have a Revolution. After a few turns of Anarchy, you will
be able to reconstitute your government.
^
Anarchy is similar to Despotism, except that the corruption
rate is VERY HIGH (see entry for Despotism).  However, no
taxes are collected during a period of Anarchy, and no
scientific research is conducted.

@title=Civilization Government: Despotism
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit above the city size costs one shield per turn.
Settlers eat one food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Up to three military units in each city will institute
"martial law", converting an unhappy citizen into a content
citizen.
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Despotism has a HIGH rate of corruption and waste.  The
level of corruption in a particular city is based on its
distance from your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under Despotism, none of the science/tax/luxury rates may
be set higher than 60%%.  ALSO, ANY SQUARE WHICH WOULD ORDINARILY
PRODUCE THREE OR MORE OF A RESOURCE (FOOD, SHIELDS, TRADE) PRODUCES
ONE LESS.
^
^HINTS
Because of Despotism's high rate of corruption, it is almost
always an inferior form of government.  Try to switch to a
Monarchy as soon as possible.

^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Monarchy has a MODERATE rate of corruption and waste.  The
level of corruption in a particular city is based on its
distance from your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Monarchy, none of the science/tax/luxury rates may
be set higher than 70%%.
^
^HINTS
Monarchy is an excellent form of government for a young
civilization.

@title=Civilization Government: Communism
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit beyond the tenth costs one shield per turn.
Settlers eat TWO food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Up to three military units in each city will institute
"martial law", converting *TWO* unhappy citizens into
content citizens (so a total of SIX unhappy citizens can
be suppressed).
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Under Communism, state control of the economy eliminates
organized crime.  Your cities, therefore, experience no
corruption.
^
^SPECIAL
All SPY units produced under Communist governments are
given VETERAN status.  Under Communism, none of the
science/tax/luxury rates may be set higher than 80%%.
^
^HINTS
Communism is best for large, far-flung empires which need
to maintain a huge military.  Use your powerful spies to
steal technology from the capitalist pigs.

@title=Civilization Government: Fascism
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit costs one shield per turn
(exclusive of Falangistas which are free of maintenance) 
Settlers eat TWO food per turn.
ONLY Fascists may produce
stormtroop units.
^
^HAPPINESS
State sponsored Fascist rallies ensure NO CITIZEN IS EVER UNHAPPY!
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Falangista efficiency ensures Fascism has NO corruption.
However, Fascism has the special disadvantage that all
SCIENCE is CUT 30%% due to the throwing out of unwanted
intellectuals.
^
^SPECIAL
Improvements which convert unhappy citizens to content
citizens (Temples, etc.) are stormed and produce "SEIZINGS" 
of gold equal to the number of citizens they would otherwise
convert.  They also require no maintenance.  The diplomatic
penalties for "fifth collumnist activities" by your Diplomats
and Spies are reduced.  Under Fascism, none of the
science/tax/luxury rates may be set higher than 80%%.
^
^HINTS
Fascism eliminates all happiness problems and provides
an excellent revenue.  Military affairs do well with no 
interference from the Cortes! (a.k.a. Senate)

@title=Civilization Government: Republic
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit costs one shield per turn.  Settlers eat TWO
food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Each military unit AFTER THE FIRST which is not in a friendly
city (or a fortress within 3 spaces of a friendly city)
causes one citizen in its home city to become unhappy.
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
The Republic has a LOW rate of corruption and waste.  The
level of corruption in a particular city is based on its
distance from your capital.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Republic, each square which ordinarily produces at
least one unit of trade produces an extra unit.
None of the science/tax/luxury rates may be set higher
than 80%%.
^
^HINTS
Switching to a Republic can give an astounding boost to your
science and tax revenues, although you'll probably have to
divert some of your trade to luxuries.  It becomes more
difficult (and expensive) to keep an army in the field, but
building the Womens Suffrage wonder can help with this
problem.

@title=Civilization Government: Democracy
^UNIT SUPPORT
Each unit costs one shield per turn.  Settlers eat TWO
food per turn.
^
^HAPPINESS
Each unit which is not in a friendly
city (or a fortress within 3 spaces of a friendly city)
causes TWO citizens in its home city to become unhappy.
^
^CORRUPTION AND WASTE
Democracies experience NO corruption or waste.
^
^SPECIAL
Under a Democracy, each square which ordinarily produces at
least one unit of trade produces an extra unit.
The units and cities of a Democracy are immune to BRIBERY
of all forms.
The science/tax/luxury rates may be set to any level
desired.
^
^HINTS
Democracies can produce spectacular amounts of revenue and
scientific research.  However, because of the severe
happiness restrictions on military units, this form of
government tends to be viable only for large, advanced
civilizations.  Increasing your luxuries rate and building
Wonders can help alleviate this problem.
