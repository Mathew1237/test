June 6th, 1944:  The Allies invade Normandy!
^
The German defenders are caught completely by surprize as the Allied forces land on four major 
beaches, the Americans at Utah and bloody Omaha, the British at Gold and Sword, and the 
Canadians at Juno.  
^
The invasion consisted of some 152,000 men and hundreds of tanks on the first day alone! The 
Germans must counterattack swiftly!
