Operation "Husky" has been a complete success despite infighting from the two main Allied 
Generals on the island, Patton and Montgomerey.  The ever snotty Monty insists that his troops 
should be the ones to deliever the "coup de grace" to the German defenders of the island while 
Patton's Army gaurds his flank.  Unfortunately for the egotistical Monty, German resistance near 
Catania is extremly fierce and Patton, seizing the opportunity, races first to Palermo, and then to 
Messina before the British Army breaks through.  Churchill wants to follow Husky up with an 
amphibious invasion of main land Italy, the "soft underbelly" of Europe.  The question is, will the 
underbelly be as soft as a kitten's, or as soft as a Rhino's?
