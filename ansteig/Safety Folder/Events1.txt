"Sichelshnitt" - Cut of the Sickle - On May 10th 1940, forty-five German divisions advanced
through the lightly-defended Ardennes forest of the French defensive lines.  This move was timed
to coincide with a massive feint by Army Group B that would smash into the Netherlands, thus
bringing the British Expiditionary Force and the French army north so that Army Group A's
Panzers could encircle, and destroy the Allied armies.

threw every Stuka available at them, the British warships did not try to defend themselves.
Rather, they fired their anti-aircraft guns against the enemy transports instead.  By doing so, they
