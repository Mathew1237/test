@title=BLITZKRIEG - 1936
Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933. Under his leadership the country developed into a ruthlessly aggressive totalitarian state. All forms of democratic government and political opposition were soon swept away. By coercion, repression and propaganda, the Nazi Party began to control German life. The Nazis pledged first to restore Germany to its 'rightful' place in Europe, and then to seek world power. The Blitzkrieg era has begun...

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:
_________________________________________
%
JAPAN
Japan's rapidly expanding industrial economy 
required vast imports of raw materials as well as 
large markets for its finished export goods. The most 
obvious source of imports and outlet for exports was 
neighboring China, the world's most populous country.
Japanese forces occupied Manchuria (a very rich piece 
of land from self-righteous China with pit-coal, iron, 
copper, lead and gold.) and called it Manchukuo as an 
independent state, with their President Poe Yi. When
and where will Japan strike next?

AXIS 
Adolf Hitler and his NSDAP rose to power in 1933 and 
marked a turning point in Germany's historical 
development. Hitler revitalized Germany's languishing
economy and promised to end the inequities of Versaille.
By 1936, Germans wonder what their Führer's first major
step will be on the international stage. The long-awaited
Anschluss with Austria? A showdown with Czechoslovakia
or Poland over their disputed German-majority provinces?
Only the enigmatic ruler in Berlin knows for sure...

FRANCE
With a revived Germany, a self-aggrandizing Italy, and an 
increasingly unstable Spain on its borders. France could 
not afford to accept this military weakness without 
abandoning its pretensions to Grand Power Status. To
compensate, the nation threw itself into a massive 
fortified works project on the Franco-German frontier 
during the early 1930s, but the Third Republic is a deeply
divided nation, with a brittle and unstable political
system, and whether it can still wheather a serious 
challenge for the hegemony of the continent remains to be 
seen...

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
In 1900 America was not yet considered one of the world's 
principal leading nations and its diplomacy was of limited 
importance in the affairs of the Great Powers. The crucial 
intervention of the United States on the Allied side in 1917 
changed this forever. In 1929, with the Wall Street Crash, 
America went into the Great Depression: President Roosevelt's 
1933 'New Deal' sought to reverse the nation's deep malaise 
and has by 1936 achived some success.

BRITISH COMMONWEALTH
Diplomatically, the UK had staked out much on the 
arbitration powers of the League ofNations, but the League's 
ineffectiveness in Manchuriain 1931 argued ill for its future 
authority. While still commited to its alliance with France 
and sensitive to the traditional balancing of power in 
continental Europe, Britain in 1936 is a nation with many 
roles but a dwindling resource base with which to accomplish 
them.

NATIONALIST CHINA
Nationalist China faces a severe challenge in this game: 
An increasingly beliggerent and imperialist Japan desires to 
expand it's resource base at China's expense. Having already 
conceded control of Manchuria to the Japanese in 1931, China 
seems destined for further clashes with the island nation. Will 
they then continue to fight, or will China be humiliatad again?

USSR
After Lenin's death and a series of behind-the-scenes intrigues, 
his lieutenant Josed Stalin emerged as the heir to the Bolshevik 
legacy. By aferocious policy of industrialization and an equally
uncompromising attitude towards political foes, Stalin had by 
1936 consolidated his position as supreme ruler of the USSR and 
returned the once-battered and ignored Russian state to the 
diplomatic table as a major power.
