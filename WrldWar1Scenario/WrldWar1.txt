You can play as:
One of the Allies:  
Britain & France; Russia; The 'Balkan Allies' (The nationalists of Serbia, Romania and Greece); or Italy.
Or one of the Central Powers:
Germany; Austria-Hungary; The Ottoman Empire with Bulgaria.
Germany has the objective in this scenario of capturing her enemies' capitals - she will win decisively if she holds Paris and Moscow, and marginally if she can conquer one (as well as keeping Berlin).
Germany is defeated marginally if she does not capture Paris or Moscow, and decisively if Berlin falls.
Only Balkan nationalists can build the 'Patriot' unit (with better vision and mobility), the Ottomans build 'Ottoman Guards' and Austria-Hungary build 'Imperial Guards' (both inferior infantry to 'modern' riflemen).
You have until November 1918, the real armistice date.
