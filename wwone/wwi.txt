	The early twentieth century was a time of rapid research and
growth. It was also a time of imperialism and militarism, nationalism
and alliances.
	Soon Europe was divided into two alliance systems, The Triple
Entente (The Western Allies) and The Triple Alliance(Central Powers).
Will you be able to win, or even survive The Great War, The War to
End All Wars? It's up to you...
