  This WW2 scenario is not only covering european or pacific theatre
  but the whole world during WW2.
  You can either play as Soviet, German, Allied or Japanese.

  Since I tried to make it as historicly acurate as possible, new technology
  is gained at the time it was originally avialble. 
  There is no normal research!

  THIS SCENARIO REQUIRES CIV 2 GOLD EDITION OR MULTIPLAYER VERSION!
  IT WON'T WORK WITH OLDER VERSIONS!  

  I've tested the scenario and there were some advance errors.
  I fixed them, but not tested it again.



  Scenarios I took artwork from:

  Fanst. Wrld. -  Master of Magic   (Terrain)
  Fasciscm Patch	            (German Infantry, Panzer)
  Conflicts -  World War I	    (Neutral/Japanese/French Infantry, Cavalry, Light Art.)

  Most new units are units from Original/WW1-Units.gif that I have changed.


  Since I started this scenario in german, there still will be some translation errors.
  If you find any mistake, or have any suggest to improve the scenario, send to:
  
    nstein@01019freenet.de

  I also still got the german version. I will update it and release it later..
