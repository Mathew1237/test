On June 22nd 1941 Operation BARBAROSSA begins. Barbarossa was the code name for the
German offensive against the Soviet Union. The invasion was originally called Fritz, then
Directive 21. The final name given to it was Barbarossa because, in legend, Fredrick
(Barbarossa) was supposedly going to rise from his sleep-like stage and restore Germany to
power. Italy (60,000 men to Ukraine), Finland, and Romania also joined the German battle
against the Soviet Union and declare war.
