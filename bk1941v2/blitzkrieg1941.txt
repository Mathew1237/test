@title=BLITZKRIEG - AWAKENING THE GIANT! (June 1941)
World War II was the largest conflict in the history of mankind.  The war was fought over millions of square miles on the ground, in the air, on and under the sea, and with the development of the German V-2 missile, at the very fringes of outer space. Men and women fought in the streets of the great cities of Europe, the arctic wastelands of Finland, the unexplored jungles of Southeast Asia, the brutal deserts of Africa, the towering peaks of the Himalayas.  Not even the United States, protected by two vast oceans was secure.  German U-Boats sunk hundreds of ships within sight of the U.S. and Canadian coasts and the Japanese managed to gain a temporary foothold in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.  People from nearly every nation on earth served in some capacity, as soldiers, sailors, relief workers, medics or nurses.  For five years, the vast majority of the worlds’ industrial capacity was used to make the implements of war.

PLAYABLE NATIONS (in playing order):
%
JAPAN - Japan saw the outbreak of the war in Europe as
an oppertunity in the pacific. While British, French
and Dutch attentions were occupied elsewhere, the 
Japanese might be able to harvest the rich resourses
of the colonial empires of South East Asia. Only the
Industrial might of America stands in the way of
such ambitions...
_________________________________________
%
GERMANY - After the Blitzkrieg successes in Poland,
Denmark, Norway, the Low Countries, France,
Yugoslavia, Greece and Northern Africa, Hitler
turnes his attention eastwards to the USSR,
the natural target for his dreams of 
pan-European 'Lebensraum'. But will the awakening
of the Russian Bear succeed?
_________________________________________
%
USA - Two decades of isolationism had confirmed the 
population's broad belief that British, French and 
German events were none of their affair: and even the
shocking Nazi success in the summer of 1940 only stirred
a minority into demanding more aid for the democratic
West. Will USA stay completely neutral in the destuctive 
war? How will USA react to future Japanese expansion?

%
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH - After the shocking defeat of 
France in 1940, Britain found itself alone against
Nazi-Germany, facing the possibility of imminent 
invasion. However, a heroic air defence that summer
forestalled Hitler's 'Operation Sealion' attack, and
by spring of 1941 German attentions had switched east.

%
NATIONALIST CHINA - Nationalist China faces a severe
challenge in this game: An increasingly beliggerent and
imperialist Japan desires to expand it's resource base 
at China's expense. Having already conceded control of
Manchuria to the Japanese in 1931, China seems destined
for further clashes with the island nation. Will they
then continue to fight, or will China be humiliatad again?

%
USSR - When Molotov brokered his surprise deal with
his German counterpart, von Ribbentrop, in the summer
of 1939, few observers expected the unnatural 
parthership to last. Will the Stalinist Russia survive
a possible German Blitzkrieg invasion?
