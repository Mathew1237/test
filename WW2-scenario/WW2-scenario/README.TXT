1. INTRODUCTION AND INSTALLATION

To install my WW2-scenario you should extract all the files
into a new folder (for example in your civ-folder).
If you also want the sounds following (reccomended), 
take backup of the original sound-files. Then just copy
my sounds into the 'sounds'-folder in your civ-folder.
----------------------------------------------------------
2. BRIEFING AND OBJECTIVES

*I want everybody to play the german-side. I had that in
mind when i made it. I made the scenario just to play the
germans!
*I you want to make your war against the allies as realistic
as possible, try to finsish one front at the time. Try to
win over the french first (that is very easy). Then take
a sneak attack on the russians.
*There is one anoying "bug", if you want to call it that, in
my scenatio. When I first started making my scenario, i forgot
to turn off the barbarian activity. Once in a weil there
i a barbarian uprising. No big problem, but somethimes anoying.
----------------------------------------------------------
3. UNITS, ADVANCES AND CITY IMPROVEMENTS

I have borrowed mostly of what you find in this scenario. This
includes units, advances and city improvments. I am not a 
professional designer so I think that is normal. I have made
some texts myself. So if you have seen my units in a other
scenario, that is the reason.
