^" We saw the first shell from the big German railroad gun as it came toward us tumbling in 
^the air and sounding like a train going through a tunnel. I like many others dove for any 
^hole we could find. At the time I found it funny that I and so many men had been afraid of 
^a noise that was harmless to us. 
^
^A short while later, I saw the jeeps flying the Red Cross's and bringing back the wounded. 
^I was to learn, if one wished to survive this war, one had to learn and understand the 
^many sounds made by both the enemy and our side.
^
^We were to learn some noises the hard way. As our regiment settled near Basse and as the 
^companies were digging in, a salvo of mortar rounds landed in the B Coy area setting the 
^Coy carrier on fire and wounding Pte. Turner, while Maj. Monk, Pte. Armstrong and CSM 
^Fraser went to give aid to Tuner, another salvo caught them all above ground wounding Pte. 
^Armstrong and several others in the Coy including Pte. Bougner, Tompkins and Lieut....., 
^in this gallant effort.

^Bravery in a case like this does not always pay off. It is hard not to help one of your 
^comrades, but it is not wise to always do so as most barrages of artillery and motor fire 
^very seldom last more than five or six minutes. "
