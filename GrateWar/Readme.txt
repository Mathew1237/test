UNITS

There are some new units and modifications. Technology
requirements have been modified a bit to prevent the civs
from getting some techs too early.

Armor (Modified pic & strenght)
Attack:8  Defence:4  Move:2  HP:3  FP:1  Build:70
A primitive tank available with Mobile Warfare. A better
armor is available with Advanced Armor discovery.

Adv. Armor
The default Armor of Civ2. Advanced Armor discovery
(Mobile Warfare & Advanced Flight) allows the techs that
are normally available with Mobile Warfare.

Zeppelin
Attack:8  Defence:1  Move:6(3)  HP:2  FP:2  Build:100
Available with Derigibles (Atomic Theory & Refining).

Fighters and Bombers have new (worse?) pictures. Bombers'
defence raised to 2, representing that they can deal with
fighters better than zeppelins can.

Freight is now available with Railroad and Capitalization
with Industrialization.

Explorer is made obsolete by Tactics. Just to prevent
any stupid AIs from building them.
