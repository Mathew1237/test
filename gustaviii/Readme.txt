Demands MGE to 
be played.

AUTHORS NOTE
This scenario is based on the "small, quick and exciting" theme. But it is also a historical scenario about the war between Russia and Sweden, 1789-90. 
You shall only play Sweden, simply because the scenario was designed for them. 
To win the scenario you need to take Russias capital, St. Petersburg. And you need to do it quick
because Russia hasn't mobilized yet, but when they do...
There are two ways to take the city: 
The conventional method, conquer your way to it. 
Or to do as the original swedish plan. Transport an army soutwest of it, there are
airbases there which will make your conquest even easier. But it will be hard to get there,
there are lots of Russian ships and if you lose one/two of your transports it might be impossible
to take the city. 
Marginal victory: take 1-4 cities. More and you can consider yourself as winner. Altough not glorious as if you would have taken St. Petersburg.
Marginal defeat: lose 1-2 cities. More and you can consider it a decisive defeat.

DAMN! A HOUSE RULE!
No i dont like House Rules either but sometimes they're needed.
You're forbidden to negotiate with Russia until a message comes up saying that youre allowed to.
Then I wouldn't recommend you to do anything other than negotiate about peace, especially not trade technologies.
When you have peace you shall quit the scenario.

SHORT HISTORY
  Gustav III sought the war becuse of three main reasons. 
His domestic position was now very weak, and the ideas that would lead to the French revolution existed even here in Sweden(with Finland). It would be strenghtened a lot if he with a succesful war would make Swedens reputation better. 
And that it also would finally end the Russian interference in Swedens domestic politic.
And of course to take back some land from Russia that Sweden have lost.
  In Europe 1787, Josef II of Austria and Katarina II of Russia discussed plans about creating a "Great Greece" with Constantinople as capital. This Nation would be under Russian protection.
The creating of this nation would of course destroy the Ottoman Empire, and so the Sultan declared war on them (Austria joined the war in 1788).
  So then Gustav III gets his golden opportunity. There is only a small problem! The Swedish Law forbids him to start a war. But he finds a way around it. He dress his own soldiers like russian Cossacks and let them attack a swedish position. Thus getting the Russian look as intruders.
  The Swedish plan was simple: their fleet would transport 15 000 men to a place souhwest of St. Petersburg (the Russian capital), bombard it as heavily that "no thought except capitulation would be able to exist in their minds (the citys inhabitants)". And then take it.
It was counting on that the Russians wouldn't be able to mobilize for offensives in Finland as they 
had a full scaled war with the Ottomans at the moment, and that the Swedish fleet was a lot better than the Russian. But the Russian fleet was as good as the Swedish one (which it showed in several sea battles) and the plan failed.
  The first year, 1788, the Swedish armies advanced and took Nyslott, but wheather problems canceled an attack on Fredrikshamn. In september they left the Russian land. 
Denmark declared war and took some cities. But after Prussian threats (some british too) they declared themselves to be neutral. The unhappiness with the war was large in the officers corp, some even did send a letter to Catharina II, claming they wanted peace. Whole this year Gustav III, famous for his cultural interests had been "star on dark sky", without him (his political talents not his warfare talents, which he by the way really hadn't) it could have gone really bad for Sweden.
  In 1789 both sides went to offensive. Altough none had any large succes. In Sweden more and more people wanted peace. 
  1790:s swedish offensive was very small. Russia had have problems with their Turkish war and they wanted peace. When a Swedish fleet gloriously defeated a Russian both Nations agreed to sign a peace treaty. 
  Then how did Gustav III succed with his goals?
He didn't gain or lose any territory. The Russian interference in the Swedish domestic politics decreased because of that Sweden had showed a military capability. But his domestic position had becamed worse... In 1792 Gustav III was assinated by Captain Jacob Anckarstrom.   


UNITS
You wont have time to build so many Units so choose well!  

_Infantry
Good in both attack and defense, and cheap. You wont have time to build so many
of the other Units. 
_Dragoons
Fast, ideal for harassing the enemy, dont try to seize a city with these.
_Siege Cannon and Field Artillery
Siege Cannon for sieges and Field Artillery...no achielly they're able to take cities as well. 
_Warships and Transport (sea)
Warships for sea-warfare and Transport for sea-transportation(trans. 3). Guard you Transports well they're expensive.
_Grenadiers
When Grenadiers in the middle of the 17 century were introduced they was mostly used in sieges but also toghether with Line Infantry, throwing grenades. But their role changed and they became more of a elite force. In this scenario they're still a sort of elite force but I think they lost that position in the Napoleon wars.
They are better in attack and worse in defense than the normal Infantry. 
_Jagiers
They looked quite the same but was trained for a mobile, guerilla war. Ignores Zones of Control and are "alpine". At first there exists only one, in Savolax were Sprengtporten has been the Colonel for some years ago.

Notes on Tactics
The linear method of warfare was used here as it was in the rest of Europe. But there was a man, Colonel Sprengtporten, who wanted a more mobile sort of war. In this days we call it Guerilla war.
Some people have asked why my values(attack, defense...) are so high. Well its because this brings more luck to the fights (something Michael Jeszenka always talks himself warm about) and that Im able to precise the values more.


NOTES ON TERRAIN and IMPROVEMENTS
The game will be much easier if you sell some improvements, but then your Finnishmen will suffer 
in many years. Will you be a tyrann or a enlightned King?

Mathias Köster
This guy really have helped me a lot, even though he wasn't able to play the scenario.

_Graphics

I did all the Infantry/Grenadier Units. Please credit me if youre going to use them. 
Also if youre creating a  17-18 century scenario and you want Infantry graphics, e-mail and maybe 
I will create some for you. 

Mathis Köster did the new battle scene and the background!
I think more people should make new battlescenes. They do really contribute to the atmosphere.

Much stuff were borrowed from MICHAEL JESZENKAs Seven Years War. That also include the Sound files.  Why so many things were from this scenario is that its exists so few good scenarios about the late 18 century. And because that he is so good. 
I dont know if he made the Renaissance Cities, but they're perfect for this scenario (Ive looked at some paintings of small cities/villages from the age).

A large amount of the terrain was made by ALEX MOR. They really gets you in the feeling your'e in Finland. 

ALLARD HOFELDT made the transport ship.

The swedish dragoon was made by TATU APHONEN. Also in the Seven Years War.
Only slightly adjusted by me. 

But most, to all the writers of The Swedish History books. 

_Other

I did the map, you're free to use it.

MICHAEL JESZENKA helped me with some scenario creating problems.
MICHAEL DAUMEN did the same thing

OTHER SCENARIOS BY ME
_Great Northern War
My first scenario. Its rewieved in the Apolyton Scenario League.
There exists a possibillity that I will try to make a new version for it, with all the changes
Michael asked for and more.

_FEEDBACK

As everyone else I like to receive comments and feedback.
